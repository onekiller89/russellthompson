        <h1>AI Agents Are Here. Now What?</h1>

        <p>Twelve months ago, the industry was still debating whether large language models were glorified autocomplete. That debate is over. In 2026, we are witnessing the emergence of something fundamentally different: <strong>autonomous AI agents</strong> that don't just respond to prompts but plan, execute, and iterate on multi-step tasks with minimal human oversight.</p>

        <p>As someone who leads automation and engineering at enterprise scale, I've watched this shift unfold from the inside. The implications for how we build, ship, and operate software are profound, and most organisations are not ready.</p>

        <h2>From Chatbots to Coworkers</h2>

        <p>The first wave of enterprise AI adoption was predictable: bolt a chat interface onto internal knowledge bases, let people ask questions in natural language, call it a day. Useful, but incremental.</p>

        <p>The agent paradigm is different. An AI agent doesn't wait for a question. Given a goal and access to tools, it <strong>decomposes the problem, plans a sequence of actions, executes them, evaluates the results, and adjusts</strong>. This is the pattern we're now seeing in tools like Claude Code, Devin, and a growing ecosystem of open-source agent frameworks.</p>

        <p>The practical impact for engineering teams is immediate:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Incident response</strong> agents that triage alerts, pull relevant logs, correlate across systems, and draft a root cause analysis before an engineer opens their laptop.</li>
            <li><strong>Infrastructure provisioning</strong> agents that take a natural-language description of a service, generate Terraform configs, run plan/apply, and validate the deployment.</li>
            <li><strong>Code review</strong> agents that don't just flag lint errors but understand architectural intent, check for security antipatterns, and suggest refactors in context.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Platform Engineering Angle</h2>

        <p>If you're running a platform engineering team, agents change the calculus on what your internal developer platform (IDP) needs to be. The traditional IDP model is a self-service portal: developers click through a UI, fill in forms, and infrastructure gets provisioned via pipelines behind the scenes.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>The agent-native IDP doesn't need a UI at all. It needs well-documented APIs, composable building blocks, and clear guardrails. The agent becomes the interface.</p>
        </div>

        <p>This means the investment shifts from building beautiful dashboards to building <strong>robust, well-described APIs and policy-as-code</strong>. Your platform needs to be machine-readable, not just human-readable. Every API endpoint, every config schema, every deployment policy needs to be something an agent can discover, understand, and safely invoke.</p>

        <h2>The Trust Problem</h2>

        <p>The hardest engineering challenge with AI agents isn't capability. It's trust. Specifically: how do you give an autonomous system the authority to take real actions in production environments without creating catastrophic failure modes?</p>

        <p>The patterns I'm seeing work in practice:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Graduated autonomy.</strong> Start agents in read-only mode. Let them observe, recommend, and draft actions for human approval. Gradually expand their action space as confidence builds.</li>
            <li><strong>Blast radius limits.</strong> Define hard boundaries: an agent can restart a single pod, but cannot delete a namespace. Can modify a staging environment, but cannot touch production without a human in the loop.</li>
            <li><strong>Audit trails.</strong> Every agent action gets logged with full context: what goal it was pursuing, what information it considered, why it chose this action over alternatives. This isn't just for compliance. It's how you debug agent behaviour and build organisational trust.</li>
            <li><strong>Kill switches.</strong> Always. Non-negotiable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What This Means for Automation Leaders</h2>

        <p>If your automation strategy is still built around traditional workflow engines and rule-based scripts, you're building for the last decade. The organisations that will lead in the next five years are the ones that figure out how to <strong>safely integrate agentic AI into their operational fabric</strong> today.</p>

        <p>That doesn't mean ripping everything out. It means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Treating your existing automation as <strong>tools that agents can orchestrate</strong>, not as the orchestration layer itself.</li>
            <li>Investing in <strong>observability and policy-as-code</strong> so agents operate within defined boundaries.</li>
            <li>Building your team's literacy around <strong>prompt engineering, agent frameworks, and AI safety</strong> alongside traditional DevOps skills.</li>
            <li>Starting small. Pick one workflow. Automate it with an agent. Learn. Iterate.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The AI agent wave is not hype. It's the logical next step of everything we've been building toward with automation, DevOps, and platform engineering. The question isn't whether it's coming. It's whether you'll be leading it or reacting to it.</p>
